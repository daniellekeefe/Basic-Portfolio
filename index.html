        <p class="info">Hello, my name, is Danielle Keefe, I am driven to learn all things media driven, specifically
            digital media.
            I have spent majority of my career in Digital Media ad operations and business development.
            I enjoy the fast pace of technology developing and evolving and the constant change, it allows me the
            ability to ALWAYS be learning. </p>
            <p>Danielle comes to MobileFuse with nearly seven years of digital media experience including two and a half years focused on mobile advertising at Burst Media. She developed a unique set of skills during her time at Burst. After learning the ropes as a traffic specialist and senior traffic specialist, Danielle joined the client services team as a client service engineer. During her time as a client service engineer she developed strong technical skills integrating multiple networks onto the adConductor ad server, managing the project from pre-sales to network launch. With her strong understanding of campaign and network management she helped grow networks through establishing best practices for publisher development, ad operations and financial reconciliation processes. In her most recent challenge at Burst, Danielle built the mobile network and product from the ground up. She integrated a 3rd party mobile ad server to initially grow the business, then lead in the strategy and development of adConductor’s versitile mobile ad server and migrated the business and partnerships onto adConductor’s proprietary platform. Danielle played a key role in building new mobile focused ad units, such as video, rich media and high impact ads, for direct and programatic sales. Danielle build a vast publisher inventory source for key demand partnerships she established. Danielle managed Burst’s mobile networks yield and maximized potential revenue. Danielle trained the Burst corporation on how to sell, manage and develop the mobile business working closely with the marketing team to create a go-to market strategy and collateral for all things mobile.</p>
